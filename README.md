[Available at https://ui-twitter-ts.zweisolutions.com/](https://ui-twitter-ts.zweisolutions.com/)

### Instructions

1. Run `npm install` in the main directory (package.json should be accurate)
    - Special Notes:
    - Source/Dev: src folder, Production: build folder
2. Run one of the commands from the [Scripts](#scripts) section. You'll most likely want `npm run start` for development and `npm run build` for production.

### Scripts

-   `npm run start`: Create development build and serve it on dev server
-   `npm run build`: Build application for production (build directory: build)
-   `npm run test`: Launch test runner in interactive watch mode
-   `npm run eject`: [See documentation here](https://create-react-app.dev/docs/available-scripts/#npm-run-eject)

### Current TODOs:

-   FaunaDB?
    -   Timestamp?
    -   Fix index -- use actual index and replace id generation system when applicable

### Dev notes

-   Using `@graphql-codegen/typescript-document-nodes` plugin for GraphQL Code Generator to allow easy importation of GraphQL AST code when bundling functions using `netlify-lambda`.
